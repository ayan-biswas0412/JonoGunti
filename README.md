# Jono-Gunti (The People Counter)

This is a people counter program that detects the number of people in a single in any road by analysing video via IP Camera of Drone or Mobile device or it can also analyze a recorded video file.I think it will be really very helpfull if anybody uses it in their drones to surveillance about that the no of peoples are roaming outside.
